topological sort = just add stack in it , first parent node u daldo then u , mere bache ke v1, v2, v3, v4, .... but.

https://youtu.be/WbbYZRr4arw?si=etUDOitI98OdPt0N - topolgical sort in graph using  dfs.

dfs + stack  = topoligical sort in graph using bfs.

topological algorithm using 
bfs , just add + stack  = iskiko he bolte kahn algorithm.
bfs + stack (topological sort) = kahn algorithm.

what is indegree? - mai as node lets say any random V , so indegree is - mere pass directly kitne nodes jude hue hai that is indegree , e.g i am V and to me there are 3 x y and x nodes are directly pointing toward me , to me , on m sie 
the total number of them is rqual to 3 , thats the solution = thats the idegree, done. indegree in kahn algorithm. we store the array of indegree, that cool.
jese he in-degree zero ho jaye queue mai daldooo.
